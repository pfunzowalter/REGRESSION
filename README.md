# REGRESSION
The photometric redshifts estimation is currently the most powerful and efficient way to estimate the distances to the extragalactic sources. The exponential data avalanche continues and this will require low cost, fast and efficient data-driven methods to analyse and make predictions from the data. In this study, we present the supervised machine learning algorithms that are used to attain the photometric redshifts of the galaxies and quasarsthat are found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 16 (SDSS DR16).

The Codes used were adopted for Chaka Mofokeng Demo Code:: https://github.com/Mofokeng-C/Classification-Photo-z_Regression_Demo
